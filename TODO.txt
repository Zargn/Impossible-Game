Todo:
- Fix death trigger when falling long distance onto floor. (The player goes into the ground and then bounce up again)
- Make a death counter.
- Make a seed based level generator.
- Save current level number to file to let the player continue where they left off on load.
- Implement background and objects based on drawings from Naomi.
