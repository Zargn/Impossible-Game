Level generator

Use the level number as a seed to get a really long random number. RandNumber

If a longer number is required, use the level number + the final 4 numbers to seed a new long random number.

Then use the random number we got to decide on platform heights and possible coins.


Begin the level with 5 flat floors with no platforms above.



Main generator loop:



Prototype 3
Create map based on imaginary player. Use the random numbers to decide if the player will jump.

int eventCoolDown = 0;
int currentNum = seeded random number with blocksNumber in the RandNumber as a seed

currentNum idea:
3.412

First letter decides event: 1 = spike, 2 = hole, 3 = Platform, 4 = Double platform, 5 = None,
If a hole is selected, second letter decides if the player will have to jump once or twice. Under 5 is one jump, over 5 is two jumps.
If a spike is selected, second letter again decides if the player will have to jump once or twice. --::--
If a Platform is selected, second letter will decide position. 1 = Two up one out, 2 = One up (If third letter is < than 5 have platform 2 out instead of 1), 4 = One down (If third letter is: 1-2.5 One out, 2.5-5 Two out, 5-7.5 Three out, 7.5-10 Four out),
  6 = Two down (If third letter is: 1-2.5 = Two out, 2.5-5 = Three out, 5-7.5 = Four out, 7.5-10 Five out.)
  After a platform is made the following events will be decided from that height. If the position decided already has a platform in a 3x3 area around the suggested choice then retry with new seed or discard.
If a Double platform is selected, the second letter will decide first platform position in the same way as event Platform.
  Third letter will decide second platforms position with same formula, but if selected height is the same or 1/-1 then retry with new seed of currentNum + RandNumber.
  If any of the positions decided already has a platform in a 3x3 area around the suggested choice discard that try.

For every spawned object a random number is made with its x and y coords + the currentNum as a seed. If the result is 5 then a coin is spawned above that object.


event = currentNum first letter
jumps = currentNum second letter

if (startZone < 5)

  startZone ++

else if (event = 1)

  






Prototype 2

if (blocksNumber in the RandNumber is 1)

  placePlatform two blocks below

if (blocksNumber in the RandNumber is 2)

  placePlatform one block below

if (blocksNumber in the RandNumber is 3)

  placePlatform one block above

if (blocksNumber in the RandNumber is 4)

  placePlatform two blocks above

if (blocksNumber in the RandNumber is 5)

  placePlatform two blocks above
  placePlatform two blocks below



ProtoType 1


if (blocksNumber in the RandNumber is 5 or above)
  
  if (blocksNumber in the RandNumber is 7.5 or above)

    PlacePlatform on the next column at two blocks higher than current height

  if else (blocksNumber in the RandNumber is 7.5 or below)

    PlacePlatform on the next column at one block higher than current height
    continue;

if else (blocksNumber in the RandNumber is 4.99 or less)

  if (blocksNumber in the RandNumber is 3.5 above
